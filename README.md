# Stickman

Stickman is a simple game in which the player scores points by hitting the target with an arrow.

## Installation

Use the Visual Studio 2019 with .NET 5 to build Stickman.

## Usage

Run stickman_.exe

Use the LEFT and RIGHT KEYS to set the power of the shot.

Use UP and DOWN KEYS to set the shot angle.

You shoot by CLICK on the Stickman - after you shoot, you can try your hand again.

You have 3 lives, you lose a life for each miss - if you lose all lives, the game is over.

Each hit on the target is a point - you can get an infinite number of points ;)
